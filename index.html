<p> —said they wanted deep learning examples that they can just download and run. No Math. No Theory. No Books.</p>
<br>
<p>It’s difficult to find deep learning examples that are open source and that also run first try without stepping through dependency hell, so try this:
Below are 10 models I have downloaded and started running on my MacBook Pro or AWS in under 10 minutes. All ran several days to several months ago — just download and go. They finish in between 5s (pre-trained neural networks) and several hours (GPU-intensive neural network training) time. But you’ve got 5 seconds, right?
Email me if the following doesn’t work for you. Seriously!<p>

The list is split into two parts —<br>
<p>Part 1: Deep Learning on AWS 7 Using APIs</p><br>
<p>Part 2: Deep Learning on iOS.</p><br>
<p>Here you go!</p><br>

<h3>3.  Flappy Bird using Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q-learning)</h3>
These are the libraries that are considered to be the top of the list by many data scientists and engineers and worth looking at them as well as at least familiarizing yourself with them.</p>
<p>And here are the detailed stats of Github activities for each of those libraries:</p>

<p>Of course, this is not the fully exhaustive list and there are many other libraries and frameworks that are also worthy and deserve proper attention for particular tasks. A great example is different packages of SciKit that focus on specific domains, like SciKit-Image for working with images.<br />
So, if you have another useful library in mind, please let our readers know in the comments section.<br />
Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
